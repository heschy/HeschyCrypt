# HeschyCrypt
is a simple library to encrypt and decrypt strings. It isn't verry secure but simple and okay. ***HeschyCrypt*** is good to save some data, but the decrypting is **verry** simple.

## Windows
In the moment I test the Library on Wine. I use the Dev-CPP IDE to Test it.

## Linux 
On Linux my Library works verry fine.

## Todo

- [ ] usable for Windows    (DEV-CPP) -- TEST IN WORK
