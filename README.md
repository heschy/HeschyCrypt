# HeschyCrypt
is a simple library to encrypt and decrypt strings. It isn't verry secure but simple and okay. ***HeschyCrypt*** is good to save some data, but the decrypting is **verry** simple.

## Windows
It works fine in Windows.

## Linux 
It dosn't works fine in Linux, I try to change this, but I don't know whats the reason for the errors, because it works fine on Windows.

## Todo

- [X] usable for Windows
- [ ] usable for Linux
